# AGC-Drive: A Large-Scale Dataset for Real-World Aerial-Ground Collaboration in Driving Scenarios

**AGC-Drive** is a large-scale, real-world dataset developed to advance autonomous driving research with aerial-ground collaboration. It enables multi-agent information sharing to overcome challenges such as occlusion and limited perception range, improving perception accuracy in complex driving environments.

While existing datasets often focus on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) collaboration, **AGC-Drive innovatively incorporates aerial views from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)**. This integration provides dynamic, top-down perspectives that effectively reduce occlusion issues and allow monitoring of large-scale interactive scenarios.
